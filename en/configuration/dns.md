# DNS

![English](../resources/englishc.svg) [![Chinese](../resources/chinese.svg)](https://www.v2ray.com/chapter_02/04_dns.html)

V2Ray has an internal DNS server which provides DNS replay for other components.

Configuration:

```javascript
{
  "hosts": {
    "baidu.com": "127.0.0.1"
  },
  "servers": [
      "8.8.8.8",
      "8.8.4.4",
      "localhost"
  ]
}
```

Where:

* `hosts`: A list of static IP addresses. Each entry has a domain name as key and IP address as value. If a DNS query targets one of the domains in this list, the corresponding IP will be returned immediately and DNS query will not be relayed.
* `servers`: A list of DNS server addresses. If there are more than one servers, they will be queried from top down. Options for DNS address:
  * `"IP"`: An IP address whose port 53 is open for DNS query.
  * `"localhost"`: A special value that V2Ray will use DNS query from local machine.

To use the internal DNS service, you need to configure `domainStrategy` in [routing](routing.md).

The DNS queries relayed by this DNS service will also be dispatched based on routing settings. No extra configuration is required.

## Query strategy

DNS service will try to query both A and AAAA record in the same DNS message. As not all DNS servers support such query, V2Ray only sends A and AAAA query to the following DNS servers, and only send A queries to all other servers.

```text
8.8.8.8
8.8.4.4
9.9.9.9
```
