## Verify

There are 2 ways to verify packages.

1. Metadata.txt in release page contains SHA1 hash for all packages.
1. The GPG signature file for executables (v2ray / v2ray.exe) can be found in v2ray.sig (or v2ray.exe.sig) in the same package. Public key is [in the repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/v2ray/v2ray-core/master/tools/release/verify/official_release.asc).

## Install on Windows or Mac OS

Run v2ray / v2ray.exe after unzip the packages.

## Install on Linux

We provide a script to install on Linux. This script detects previous installed v2ray and then upgrade or install a new one accordingly. If there is a previous version, the config file in /etc/v2ray will not be overwritten during upgrade.

The following command assumes root permission.

Run the following command to install V2Ray. If yum or apt is available, the script will install unzip and daemon / systemd. They are required to run V2Ray as a service. You need to install them manually if your Linux system doesn't support yum or apt.

```shell
bash <(curl -L -s https://install.direct/go.sh)
```

The script installs the following files.

* `/usr/bin/v2ray/v2ray`: V2Ray executable
* `/usr/bin/v2ray/v2ctl`: Utility
* `/etc/v2ray/config.json`: Config file
* `/usr/bin/v2ray/geoip.dat`: IP data file
* `/usr/bin/v2ray/geosite:dat`: domain data file

This script also configures V2Ray to run as service, if systemd is available.

Configurations are at the following places.

* `/etc/systemd/system/v2ray.service`: Systemd
* `/etc/init.d/v2ray`: SysV

After installation, we will need to:

1. Update `/etc/v2ray/config.json` file for your own scenario.
1. Run `service v2ray start` command to start V2Ray.
1. Optionally run `service v2ray start|stop|status|reload|restart|force-reload` to control V2Ray service.

### go.sh

go.sh supoorts the following parameters.

* `-p` or `--proxy`: Use a proxy to download V2Ray packages. Same as curl format, such as `"socks5://127.0.0.1:1080"` or `"http://127.0.0.1:3128"`.
* `-f` or `--force`: Force installation. The script will assume V2Ray was not installed at all.
* `--version`: The version to be installed, such as `"v1.13"`. Default value is the latest stable release.
* `--local`: Use a local package for installation.

Examples:

* Use SOCKS proxy 127.0.0.1:1080 to install the latest package: ```./go.sh -p socks5://127.0.0.1:1080```
* Install v1.13 from local file:```./go.sh --version v1.13 --local /path/to/v2ray.zip```

## Docker

V2Ray provides 2 docker images:

The 2 images has the same structure as the Linux installation.
