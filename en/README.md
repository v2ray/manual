Project V is a set of tools to help you build your own private network over the internet. The core of Project V, named `V2Ray`, is responsible for network protocols and communications. It can work alone, or in combination with other tools.

This website is primarily a manual for V2Ray, with some additional information regarding the whole project.

## Features

* Multiple inbound/outbound proxies: one V2Ray instance supports in parallel multiple inbound and outbound protocols. Each protocol works independently.
* Customizable routing: incoming traffic can be sent to different outbounds based on routing configuration. It is easy to route traffic by target region or domain.
* Multiple protocols: V2Ray supports multiple protocols, including Socks, HTTP, Shadowsocks, VMess etc. Each protocol may have its own transport, such as TCP, mKCP, WebSocket etc.
* Obfuscation: V2Ray has built in obfuscation to hide traffic in TLS, and can run in parallel with web servers.
* Reverse proxy: General support of reverse proxy. Can be used to build tunnels to localhost.
* Multiple platforms: V2Ray runs natively on Windows, Mac OS, Linux, etc. There is also third party support on mobile.
